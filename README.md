TARCIS: Time And Relative Courses in Space
==========================================

Installation `git clone` the repo. Install the bookmarklet (more on that later)

The command syntax is: `ruby set_timings.rb course_list.txt dates.txt`

If you leave off `dates.txt` it will default to `reset.txt` which will set all the dates to `""`, effectively un-timing them.

Sit back and relax while the computer sets the term dates.
